                ABOUT THE MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (MEN) PROGRAM
              </h1>
              <p>
                - The Bachelor Program in Mechanical Engineering (MEN) at VGU is
                a fulltime program consisting of seven semesters (three and a
                half years) excluding a foundation semester (or 1/2 academic
                year).  The program consists of a combination of fundamentals of
                natural sciences and mathematics with mechanical engineering
                basics. Students can choose between two majors "Engineering
                Design and Automation" or "Energy and Process Engineering". The
                program provides students with expert skills and knowledge
                needed for a career in industry as well as a broad and solid
                academic foundation for the continuation of their studies in
                post-graduate programs.
                <br /> <br />- The language of teaching, learning and assessment
                is English. <br /> <br />- After completion, the graduates will
                be awarded double degrees (Bachelor of Science degree) in
                Mechanical Engineering conferred by both Ruhr-University
                Bochum (RUB), Germany and VGU, Vietnam.

                - Ruhr-University Bochum is the partner university for the
                Mechanical Engineering program at VGU. Ruhr-University is
                located at the heart of the Ruhr area, once famous for its coal
                mining industry.
                <br />
                <br />- Since its foundation in 1962 and operation in 1965 it
                has developed under the guiding principle "universitas" and the
                motto "human, open to the world, accomplished" to one of the
                five largest Universities in Germany, being the academic home of
                more than 42,000 students currently. Its focus on international
                collaboration has resulted in over 15 dual degree study programs
                and nearly 6,000 international students participating in
                everyday education.

                opens doors worldwide in industry and academia. RUB educates
                students at VGU to become highly qualified Engineers with
                internationally recognized education standards. Personally, it
                is a pleasure for me to teach at VGU, seeing highly motivated
                students revealing their talents and gaining expertise at fast
                pace in an environment with high standards both in education and
                research.&quot;
